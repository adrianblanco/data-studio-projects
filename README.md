# Data Studio Projects

Repository for discussion and submission of projects for the [Lede Program](http://ledeprogram.com)'s Data Studio course. Magic generally happens in [the issues section](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues).

## Schedule

Your week will look like this:

* **Tuesday:** New pitches/tiny drafts due
* **Friday:** First revision due
* Next **Tuesday:** Second revision due
* Next **Friday:** Publish your final version

...I might change it so things aren't due on the same day, but I'm not sure yet.

## Project submission process

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues) for your pitch [(Example)](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues/1)
2. Receive and respond to feedback [(Example)](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-315367706)
3. Submit a draft of your piece as a comment to your issue, using the [update template](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/blob/master/UPDATE_TEMPLATE.md) 
4. Receive and respond to feedback
5. Submit a revision of your piece as a comment to your issue, using the [update template](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/blob/master/UPDATE_TEMPLATE.md) 
6. Receive and respond to feedback
7. Submit the final version of your piece on your site and as a comment to your project issue, using the [final template](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/blob/master/FINAL_TEMPLATE.md). [(Example)](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-315379158)


### STEP ONE: Pitch (Tuesday)

To create a pitch, visit the [issues section](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues) and create a **new issue**. Fill out the pitch form.

The pitch is **not** just "here is a story idea." You should have found several data sets, opened them, cleaned them, and produced some preliminary graphics.

After you post your pitch, you will receive **two pieces of feedback** from other students.

### STEP TWO: First draft (Friday)

Your first draft should be **as close to a publishable piece as possible.** Add it to your issue as a **new comment**. [(Example)](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-315374945)

You should be proud of it. **Make it nice.**

> In each of these steps, discuss problems you're having, questions you're wondering, and anything else you'd like input on.

Aren't sure how to make a graphic nice? Well, that's what this class is about, but you can also [use this simple data visualization guide](designingviz.com).

After you post your first draft, you will receive **two pieces of feedback** from other students.

### STEP THREE: Revision (Tuesday)

Even though you worked so hard on your first draft, it could definitely be better! So you're going to make it better.

Add it to your issue as a **new comment**. You will receive **two pieces of feedback**.

### STEP FOUR: Final (Friday)

Your final draft needs to be posted two ways: 

1. As a published piece on your **personal web site** (that's the thing in the `docs/` folder)
2. As a comment on your issue, which follows the [final template](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/blob/master/FINAL_TEMPLATE.md). [(Example)](https://github.com/jsoma/data-studio-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-315379158)

## How to give project feedback

Giving good feedback is super difficult! But here's a fine guide:

1. Say something you like about it
2. Say something you think you be improved (or just something that could be changed)
3. Be specific and give examples
4. Try to answer any questions they've asked

Let's say the graphic is the worst thing you've ever seen. Is the idea good? Is the topic interesting?

One thing to remember is **your feedback very well may be terrible and wrong.** But that's okay! No one has to listen to it, it's all just ideas.
